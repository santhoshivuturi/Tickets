Hi I'm Santhoshi and I'm learning Hadoop and 
I have finished Hadoop and It was very easy and very understandable but
Lot of the Hadoop components which I have learned are Deprecated and are not in use 
so now I'm learning spark with scala and python. Which is also i'm finding it easy but
let's see what happens.
