Using pig with hive using HCatalog:
Loading a table present in hive using hcatalog and then manipulationg it.

Step:1
pig -useHCatalog
-- We should load the pig like above using Hcatalog

Step:2
A = LOAD 'santhoshivuturi.sqoop_workspace' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
-- This is how we load a table from hive to pig using and refering to the database and table name and then we will be using HCatloader.

Step:3
describe A;
-- This will give schema

Step:4
B = foreach A generate id;
-- This will only generate ID from the hive table which we have loaded into pig.

step:5
STORE B INTO 'santhoshivuturi.A' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();
-- After doing the required manipulations in pig then we are usinh hcatstorer and then storing back the data into hive table 
-- Before this we need to create a table in hive using the same schema which the variable have in pig.
