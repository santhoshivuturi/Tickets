persisting:

Persisting RDD — persist Methods
persist(): this.type
persist(newLevel: StorageLevel): this.type
persist marks a RDD for persistence using newLevel storage level.

You can only change the storage level once or persist reports an UnsupportedOperationException:

Cannot change storage level of an RDD after it was already assigned a level
Note
You can pretend to change the storage level of an RDD with already-assigned storage level only if the storage level is the same as it is currently assigned.
If the RDD is marked as persistent the first time, the RDD is registered to ContextCleaner (if available) and SparkContext.

The internal storageLevel attribute is set to the input newLevel storage level.

Unpersisting RDDs (Clearing Blocks) — unpersist Method
unpersist(blocking: Boolean = true): this.type
When called, unpersist prints the following INFO message to the logs:

INFO [RddName]: Removing RDD [id] from persistence list
It then calls SparkContext.unpersistRDD(id, blocking) and sets NONE storage level as the current storage level.
