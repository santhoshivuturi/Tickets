Caching:
The same principles apply for caching RDDs as for DataFrames and Datasets. You can either cache
or persist an RDD. By default, cache and persist only handle data in memory. We can name it if we
use the setName function that we referenced previously in this chapter:
words.cache()

We can specify a storage level as any of the storage levels in the singleton object:
org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel, which are combinations of memory only; disk only;
and separately, off heap.
